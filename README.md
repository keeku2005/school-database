The School Information Management System is a PostgreSQL-based database project designed to efficiently organize and manage academic information in a school environment. It maintains records of pupils, instructors, grades, subjects, results, and payments within a structured relational model. The project demonstrates how SQL can be used to handle real-world school operations such as storing student details, assigning teachers to grades, recording exam results, and tracking fee payments. Using PostgreSQL features like foreign keys, joins, and aggregate functions, this system provides meaningful insightsâ€”such as top-performing students, pending payments, and instructor allocations. It serves as an educational project that highlights the use of database normalization, data integrity, and relational queries in school data management.
